# Project_3: IndyCar 2024 Data Analysis
1. Overview: This project will pull data from the 2024 IndyCar season and process the data so create visualizations that can be interacted with. The visuals will show how different stats can be tracked across the 17 races that took place in the 2024 season.

2. Interaction: To interact with the project, use the filters applied to each table to see how it changes the statistics.

3. Ethical Considerations: The data pulled from the INDYCAR Series database is entirely unbiased and randomly selected, ensuring that no analysis is selective. In addition, we used their official site, so as to not misrepresent the series results. Another consideration we took, is protecting the personal information of racers so as to not profile the racers.
